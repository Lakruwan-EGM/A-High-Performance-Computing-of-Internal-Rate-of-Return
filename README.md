Research Project: A High-Performance Computing of Internal Rate of Return using a Centroid based Newton-Raphson Iterative Algorithm

Here, I have developed a new method to calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), developing the already existing Newton-Rhapson algorithm to increase accuracy and efficiency.
The existing midpoint-based method has high accuracy and high convergence rate, but it can be problametic in unequal cashflows, since it does not consider the distribution of the cashflow into account. The proposed centroid method tackles these issues, converging quickly with minimal error, even for uneven cash flows. 
Through simulations, this study demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the mid-point-based Newton-Raphson algorithm, making it a valuable tool for more accurate IRR calculations and better investment decisions in all situations.
